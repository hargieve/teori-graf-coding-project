Travelling Salesman Problem, Chinese Postman Problem, and Knight’s Tour With



In computer science and algorihtm courses variously 'classical' problems are introduced to illustrate optimization, search algorithms and constraint/logic programming.

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This problem searches the shortest path which has to pass through every node exactly once and come back to its origin.

Chinese Postman Problem (CPP)

In this problem, we want to find the shortest closed path that contains all edges at least once and returns back where it started.

Knight’s Tour

This is a famous problem which asks for a sequence of knight moves on a chessboard such that the knight visits each square exactly once.
